Globally the electricity sector constitutes about 25% of GHG emissions.

Many countries around the world are shifting away from fossil-based electricity generation and focusing on low carbon technologies such as renewable energy.

The share of fuels in the electricity generation mix determines the emissions intensity of electricity generation i.e. how much greenhouse gas emissions are made per unit of electricity produced.
